What's that ?
=============

Here is a very basic Flask server

Do I need something else ?
==========================
You need to don't forget your virtual env ;)

Flask==0.10.1
Jinja2==2.7
MarkupSafe==0.18
Werkzeug==0.9.1
blinker==1.3
ipython==0.13.2
itsdangerous==0.22
nose==1.3.0
wsgiref==0.1.2


How to use it ?
===============
In your virtual environment, simply launch __init__.py file ::

    $ python __init__.py
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    * Restarting with reloader

and ... go to your browser at localhost:5000
